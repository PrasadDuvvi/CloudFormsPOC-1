# POC Agenda

## Summary
The Mid-Market Specialist SA team is skilled in but not equipped, staffing wise, to handle a steady stream of POCs. Free POC should be used tactically and as a tool for particularly large deals. The purpose of the POC is to prove that our technology can do what's advertised in their own environment. In most cases the customer is better served with a customized demo showing the particular feature demonstrated by the customer. 

## Restrictions
* This POC will not be conducted on a production environment.
* Upon completion of the POC testing phase, the customer will remove the POC environment.  
* All POC must be approved by the regional Mid-Market Sales Specialist and the Mid-Market Specialist Solution Architect.
